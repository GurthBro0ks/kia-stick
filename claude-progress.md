## Remaining Unknowns

- `/home/slimy` harness path was not present on this machine; local repo harness was present and loaded.
- npm audit reports 7 dependency advisories from the current Next dependency tree; no forced breaking upgrade was applied.
- `/media/mint/SHARED/APWU` remains out of scope and untouched.
- Local untracked `DB/` archive folder was observed by filename only and is ignored, not committed.
- `next build` still prints Next's flat-ESLint plugin detection warning, but lint/typecheck/build pass.
- Next safe phase should be implementation planning for private-vault UI scaffolding only after explicit approval; no real-document reads/copies/indexing/scanning are approved by v0.2.
